                <p>A computer virus is a code or program that is <br> 
                capable of affecting your computer data by <br>
                corrupting or destroying them. Virus refers to <br> 
                any type of malicious software program or "malware". <br>
                Viruses can make duplicate copies of itself at a <br>
                rapid pace. They spread across every folder and <br>
                damage the data of the computer system.</p>

                <p>Computer can find their way into your computer through many methods:</p>

                    <li>Using a pen drive</li>

                    virus spread or replicate. Most have a search routine which <br>locates new files or 
                    disks to infect.</li>
                    <li><span class = "viruses">Trigger:</span> A compiled version of the virus that

                    performs the virus' purpose. Virus activity is noticeable if <br>computer slows down
                    or freezes. Sometimes freezing is the virus' payload.</li>
